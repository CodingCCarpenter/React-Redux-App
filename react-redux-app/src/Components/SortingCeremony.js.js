                    <p>"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
                    But don't judge on what you see,
                    I'll eat myself if you can find
                    A smarter hat than me.</p>

                    <p>You can keep your bowlers black,
                    Your top hats sleek and tall,
                    For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
                    And I can cap them all.</p>

                    <p>There's nothing hidden in your head
                    The Sorting Hat can't see,
                    So try me on and I will tell you
                    Where you ought to be.</p>

                    <p>You might belong in <span className='houseGryffindor'>Gryffindor</span>,
                    Where dwell the brave at heart,
                    Their daring, nerve and chivalry,
                    Set Gryffindors apart;</p>

                    <p>You might belong in <span className='houseHufflepuff'>Hufflepuff</span>,
                    Where they are just and loyal,
                    Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
                    And unafraid of toil;</p>

                    <p>Or yet in wise old <span className='houseRavenclaw'>Ravenclaw</span>,
                    If you've a ready mind,
                    Where those of wit and learning,
                    Will always find their kind;</p>

                    <p>Or perhaps in <span className='houseSlytherin'>Slytherin</span>,
                    You'll make your real friends,
                    Those cunning folk use any means,
                    To achieve their ends.</p>

                    <p>So put me on! Don't be afraid!
                    And don't get in a flap!
                    You're in safe hands <span>(Though I have none!)</span>
                    For I'm a Thinking Cap!"</p>
